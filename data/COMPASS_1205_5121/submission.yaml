  CERN-SPS.  Measurements of the transverse spin azimuthal asymmetry of charged hadrons produced in  semi-inclusive  deep inelastic scattering of a MU+ beam of energy 160 GeV from a transversely polarised   ammonia target.   This paper reports the Collins asymmetry of the proton extracted in the Bjorken X range   0.003-0.7.  Data are given for the 2010 data se over the full kinematic range as well as in restricted ranges.  Data are also given in the final tables for the full range using the combined 2007 (PL B692(2010),240) and  2010 data sets.  A second paper (CERN-PH-EP-2012-147, arXiv:1205.5122) reports the Sivers asymmetry and is linked below.   A link is also given to the correlation matrices between the three variables, X, Z and PT.
