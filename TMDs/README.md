# Port the TMDs
Make sure that the path to LHAPDF is listed in your environmental variables. Then execute the command 

source setup.bash

to finish the port.

You will then need to move the folders gen_grid_FF/FDSS_PIP and gen_grid_PDF/CT14TMD to your share/LHAPDF directory.

Then you can run the benchmarks in test.ipynb.
